## SpringCalculations

This MATLAB script was created to identify all possible custom spring designs that meet a given set of requirements, assuming the use of **music wire** as the material.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- MATLAB

## üìå Purpose
The script helps filter viable spring configurations based on:
- Physical constraints
- Force requirements
- Material properties (specifically for music wire)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This script performs a **brute-force search**, which can be **slow** depending on the parameter range.
- It may generate a **large number of results**, so it's recommended to narrow your input criteria as much as possible.

This project reflects my experience with engineering design automation and custom mechanical component selection using MATLAB.
